// error) so a later poll re-leases and resumes it; a write failure returns the
// error so the caller skips derivation rather than aggregating a stale child
// state.

// This is the inverse of markOperationFromApplyState: the operator drives each
// operation row to its state, then the parent apply's state follows from the
// aggregate via state.DeriveRolloutApplyState, the policy-aware projection over
// all operation rows. Under on_failure "continue" a terminal-failed sibling no
// longer terminalizes the apply while other siblings are still in flight; the
// apply is held running until the rollout settles, then takes the failed verdict.
// Every other policy (halt, pause, unrecognized) fails closed to the failed
// verdict. While an apply has exactly one operation the derived value equals the
// value ResumeApply already persisted, so this is a no-op until the
// multi-deployment fan-out makes an apply own more than one operation.
//
// The caller is responsible for lease scoping: the active operator path passes a
// lease-scoped context so the write fails closed after ownership changes; the
// terminal-parent reconciliation path passes an unscoped context, which is safe
// because a terminal parent has no competing driver and the terminal-to-non-
// terminal guard below refuses to revive it.
